/**
 * Create shipping labels at a web service by passing Magento shipment requests through multiple configurable stages.
 *
 * When a shipping label is to be created for a placed order, Magento provides all relevant shipping data to the carrier
 * as a "shipment request" object. Pipeline stages process and transform the request to become suitable for sending
 * it to the carrier-specific web service, then send and transform it back to application data. The result of running
 * the pipeline is the artifacts container where all stages add their output data to. Consequently, the overall pipeline
 * result (i.e. the label data and tracking number) can afterwards be obtained from the artifacts container.
