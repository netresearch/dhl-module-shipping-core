/**
 * Collect rates from a web service by passing the Magento rates request through multiple configurable stages.
 *
 * When shipping methods are to be prepared for placing an order, Magento provides all relevant quoting data to the
 * carriers as a "rate request" object. Pipeline stages process and transform the request to become suitable for sending
 * it to the carrier-specific web service, then send and transform it back to application data. The result of running
 * the pipeline is the artifacts container where all stages add their output data to. Consequently, the overall pipeline
 * result (i.e. the carrier's products which are suitable for the given cart) can afterwards be obtained from the
 * artifacts container.
